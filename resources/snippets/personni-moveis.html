    This was my final university project. The main idea was to create a web based platform for furniture e-commerces that would offer a 
    new and dynamic manner of selling. The solution is aimed at medium and small enterprises wich don't have a well established e-commerce, but could be adopted by any kind of furniture
    related business. The objective was reached and some new features for customization were added.
</p>
<p id="personni-moveis-p2" class="selected-project__p">
    The main focus of the project, offering a different sale strategy integrated in the e-commerce, gives site admins or business managers the tools to specify models for a kind
    of furniture, having all characteristics that the customer could desire, such as exchanging for a different part of a furniture, different materials, composition, and other 
    characteristics, everything can be handled by administrators, as much for the limits present in the furniture, giving the hability to maintain the limits and production capacity of the
    store's factory. After administrators specify the furniture model and options, the store clients are able to follow a modeling journey, through iterative steps, selecting the disired 
    characteristics off a chair, for example, the client can see the value of the product modeled, if conforming to it's expectations, the client would next purchase of the product.

    Besides this different buying journey, standard selleing chacracteristics existing in e-commerces were added, such as the sale of standart non customizable produtos and 
    personalized furniture, wich enolve making few customizations in a fixed, standard furniture piece. Additional features added where:
