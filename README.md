# My portfolio.

[Leia em portuguÃªs](README_pt-BR.md)

This portfolio showcases detailed information about myself, my skills as a software developer, and my projects. It is hosted via Github Pages and was entirely built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript, using the fewest dependencies possible, which include:

 * PDF.js - to render my resumes in real-time on the page;
 * font-awesome - Icons and symbols.

## In my portfolio, I have added features to enhance content visualization and dynamism, such as:

 * Use of query parameters to allow users to share the portfolio link in their preferred language or with emphasis on a specific project. Clicking the link loads the page in the selected language, and the browser automatically scrolls to the relevant project content.

 * Instant language switching using programmatically managed JSON translation files. These files automatically apply text changes when the user chooses to switch between Portuguese and English;
 
 * Flexible code structure, easily expandable by adding new JSON files to enable other languages; Real-time rendering of HTML snippets using the fetch API, native to browsers 

 * Modular code with comments following the JSDoc standard (allowing automatic documentation generation from the source code).
